Synthetic Network Data Generator

Overview        
I have designed a Python script to generate synthetic network data using the linear regression model. The design aims to generate synthetic network data, focusing on simulating various bandwidth and delay conditions and their impact on Quality of Experience (QoE).


Requirements        
Before running this script, you must have the following installed:        
    • Python 3.6 or higher        
    • Pandas library        
    • NumPy library        
    • Scikit-learn library        



Installation        
    1. Install Python: Make sure that Python 3.6 or later is installed on your system. Link to download Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/            
    2. Install Required Libraries: Use pip to install the necessary Python libraries:             
         pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn                 
    3. Clone or Download This Repository: Download the provided script files to your local machine, or clone the repository using Git.        



Usage        
    1. Prepare Your Dataset: Make sure your dataset is formatted correctly with columns for Bandwidth, Delay, and QoE.         
    2. Run the Script: Execute the script using Python. Navigate to the script's directory in your terminal and run:        
         python synthetic_data_generator.py        
    3. Check the Output: The “bandwidth_delay.txt” and “qoe.txt” files contain the synthetic bandwidth and delay data, and the corresponding QoE values, respectively.
